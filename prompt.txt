You are an expert at converting messy Excel timestamp data into clean CSV format.
I will give you an Excel-like data dump inside <DOCUMENT> tags.
The structure is irregular: each "row" contains one or more YouTube links followed by one or more timestamps (usually in mm.ss format like 2.38 or 12.45), and cells are separated by commas.
Timestamps for the same video are often listed one per line (vertical), sometimes with empty lines between groups.
There may also be extraneous text (like labels or notes) that are neither URLs nor timestamps; these should be ignored and removed.
Your task:

Treat each logical row separately (rows are separated by mostly empty lines or numbered as row1, row2, etc.)
Parse the row by splitting on commas to get a list of tokens (ignoring newlines as formatting).
Iterate through the tokens:
If a token starts with "https://" and is a YouTube link, treat it as a new link and collect subsequent valid timestamps for it.
A valid timestamp is a string matching the pattern of numbers with a dot (e.g., \d+.\d+ like 0.00, 1.23, 10.50).
Ignore any tokens that are empty, or are text that is neither a link nor a valid timestamp.
Collect ALL following valid timestamps for the current link (until the next link or end of row).

Convert the collected timestamps for each link into a SINGLE semicolon-separated string, like: 0.13;0.42;1.11;1.55;3.05
Keep exactly the same format/numbers as in the source (including leading zeros, decimals, etc.)
Do NOT add extra spaces around semicolons
If only one timestamp → still write it alone (no semicolon)
If no timestamps after a link → write nothing after the comma (just ,)

Output format = clean CSV, one line per original data row
Only include fields for links and their timestamp strings (link,timestamps,link,timestamps,...).
No extra quotes unless the field actually contains comma or semicolon
Empty rows should be preserved as blank lines or lines with only commas (,,,,,, etc.) to indicate empty.
If a row contains only ignored text and no links/timestamps, output it as an empty row.
Do NOT add header row
Do NOT add row numbers in output

Make sure links stay exactly as they are (including query parameters like &t=223s, &list=..., etc.)
Example of desired output style:

Now here is the data:
<DOCUMENT filename="whatever.xlsx">

(paste your entire <SHEET> content here)
</DOCUMENT>
Please convert it to clean CSV following the rules above.
Output only the CSV content, no explanations unless I ask.
